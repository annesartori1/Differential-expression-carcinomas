\*\*Differential Gene Expression in High and Low Grade Head and Neck Carcinomas\*\*



This repository contains work for my final project for Genomics Data Mining and Statistics, BS 831 (BU School of Public Health), Spring, 2025.

Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are malignancies of the oral cavity, pharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, nasal cavity, and salivary glands that together constituted the seventh most common cancer diagnosis worldwide in 2023. A 2015 Nature article by authors affiliated with the Cancer Genome Atlas provided a comprehensive genomic characterization of HNSCCs. My report analyzes a subset of those authors' data, gaining insight into the growth of tumors by identifying differences in gene expression between high-grade (G3) and low-grade (G1) tumors.

\*\*Description of (private) Data:\*\*  

This report is based on a subset of the data described in "Comprehensive genomic characterization of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas," The Cancer Genome Atlas Network, *Nature*, Vol 517, January 2015, pp. 576-582. The data are stored in an ExpressionSet.
